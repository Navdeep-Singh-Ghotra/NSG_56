```
String s = "";
for (int n = N; n > 0; n /= 2) {
    s = (n % 2) + s;
}
```

######
4. Write a static method lg() that takes an int value N as argument and returns the largest int not larger than the base-2 logarithm of N. Do not use Math
numbers.

######
5. Write a static method histogram() that takes an array a[] of int values and
an integer M as arguments and returns an array of length M whose ith entry is the num-
ber of times the integer i appeared in the argument array. If the values in a[] are all
between 0 and Mâ€“1, the sum of the values in the returned array should be equal to
a.length.
